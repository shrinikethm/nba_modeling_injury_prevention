# NBA Injury Prevention Project

Overview: We expect to produce a reliable injury prediction model that identifies NBA players at
higher risk of injury. This model will help teams take proactive measures to prevent
injuries, extend player careers, and improve overall team performance. Additionally,
it will offer financial benefits by reducing medical costs and minimizing the impact of
injuries on player salaries.
